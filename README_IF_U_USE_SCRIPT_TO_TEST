1. Simply copy build_and_test.sh and tests_lab* under your local repo CS232

2. To test all your tasks under lab*, you can launch test script:
./build_and_test.sh lab*
for instance
./build_and_test.sh lab3 
to test lab3

3. Do not fret when you see your code has failed to pass a test -- take a look 
at the diff result. If the difference is merely blank/tab/spaces/uppercases/typos
that does not have anything to do with actual functionalities of the task, then 
it is minor, because I do review it in the second pass. However, if any mismatch 
comes from failures of required functionalities, then you should treat it seriously.

4. Again, your code must build without any errors or warnings.

5. Last but not least, passing tests does not mean full points guaranteed. It means
that if your code have satisified all requirements, then it is likely not going to 
lose major points.
